Name of contact:

The mentor (or alum) I contacted is Andrew Glass
Date of contact: "01/2930/2017"

Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

I reached out to Andrew in mod1 and he agreed to be my mentor.

We had an introductury screen hero during the first couple weeks in Mod1.

We continued to have weekly screen heros throughout mod1. He is on vacation in Israel right now but we plan on continuing our weekly sessions when he gets back.

How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development?

Andy has been a rails developer for 5 years now so he has plenty of technical knowledge to share with me. I look forward to discussing my personal project with him. I want to find out what new languages/technologies could be good to include in my project that employers would like to see.
